# Over the Bird's Eye View: Predicting the IDX Composite by Twitter and Macroeconomic Variables
-- An Undergraduate Thesis Log --

Hello. 
Rein is currently not bored because he's doing this Machine Learning stuff for his thesis.

He aspire to create a prediction model for IDX Composite or IHSG using Macroeconomic Variables and Twitter Sentiment Score.
The basis of his project is Bollen et al. (2011) which predicted the movement of DJIA using Twitter Sentiment. Domestically,
he also refer to Alamsyah et al. (2018) that predicted the movement of IDX Composite using Macrovars with ANN. To take a step
forward, the idea of this paper is to combine both element with a faster time frame--in this case 'daily'.

And so, this repository serves as Rein's coding log on using Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict the daily movement of IDX Composite.
